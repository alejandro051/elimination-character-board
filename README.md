HEY LISTEN!

I started this because way back when I was a kid playing melee with my brother, we would always play elimination style. Essentially the person who loses is not able to use that character anymore and we would play like that until you ran out of characters to use. 

I thought it would be fun to do the same with the new Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection with my bro. I tried looking online for anything like this because I really didn't want either of us to have to keep track of which characters we eliminated from use but didn't have much luck. I am sure that someone somewhere has to have made this but I have not found it so I thought why not try and make it myself. This probably seems like an overkill alternative to just keeping track of eliminated characters on paper but I am having fun working on it so whatever.

This is the first time I have ever coded something outside of a work setting so if anyone has comments or advice I am all ears!

For now it is going to be a board for MVC2 elimination, but I will probably expand this in the future with multiple preset boards with navigation and maybe even a way for people to create custom elimination boards on the fly.

Currenlty going to host this on GitHub Pages :
